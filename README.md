## Stock Market Analysis Using PCA and K-means Clustering
This is a group of projects that I did during my studies.

This project aims to analyze stock market data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. The goal is to identify patterns and clusters within real-time stock price data, facilitating market segmentation and potential investment strategies.
